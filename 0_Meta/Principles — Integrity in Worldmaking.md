## ⚖️ Integrity in Worldmaking: Mythos and Logos

*Worldmaking Basics* rests on two interwoven modes of coherence:

- **World*crafting* — logos**  
  The construction of **content**: the cosmological, physical, and **ontological** structures that define *how the universe is.*  
  Logos gives a world its **consistency** — the underlying rules, limits, and truths that hold it together.

- **World*building* — mythos**  
  The cultivation of **context**: the social, cultural, and experiential dynamics that shape *how characters transact within the world.*  
  Mythos gives a world its **continuity** — the lived coherence that lets meaning flow through events, choices, and relationships.

When either falters, immersion breaks:  
- Without **consistency**, the world feels arbitrary.  
- Without **continuity**, it feels hollow and uninhabited.

Worldmaking thrives where **worldcrafting shapes the content of reality**  
and **worldbuilding shapes the context of living within it.**

*Worldmaking Basics* attends to both worldcrafting (i.e., **Crafting**) and worldbuilding (i.e., **Building**).

However, it leans more heavily toward the Crafting side — not because Building is unimportant, but because there already exists an immense landscape of resources devoted to the cultural, narrative, and thematic aspects of milieu creation.  

WMB has no need (nor any desire) to compete with them.

Instead, its purpose is to articulate and clarify the **logosic foundations** — the physical, cosmological, and ontological content of worlds — so that whatever mythosic contexts readers choose to create can rest upon solid, intelligible ground.

A story with a perfect plot but impossible (or just inconsistent) physics feels hollow; a world with flawless mechanics but forgotten motives feels sterile.  Together, continuity and consistency form the complementary disciplines of **mythosic** and **logosic** integrity — the Twin Maladies of *plot holes* and *potholes*.
## 🧩 Plot Holes and the Continuity of Story

**Plot holes break stories.**

A **plot hole** is a *mythosic inconsistency* — a point where the sequence or causality of a narrative fails to agree with itself.  

It’s the story-level counterpart to a **pothole**: an error not in physics or cosmology, but in the logic of events, motivations, or information.  

> **Example — The Vanishing Sword:**  
> A hero’s blade shatters in chapter seven, yet reappears unbroken in chapter nine.  
> The reader’s mind stumbles: *“Wait — didn’t that sword break?”* 
> 
> Attention shifts from empathy (*“will she win?”*) to dissonance (*“the story forgot itself”*), and the thread of belief is cut.

## 🧩 Potholes and the Consistency of Reality

**Potholes break the cosmos.**

A **pothole** is a *logosic inconsistency* — a fracture in the physics, construction, or functional logic of the underlying reality-framework that snaps the illusion of a coherent environment, often in ways obvious even to casual readers or players.

> **Example — The Sudden Third Moon:**  
> A world has two well-established moons. Then, midway through the story, a third moon casually appears in the sky — unnamed, unremarked, and never mentioned before or after.
> 
> The reader stumbles: *“Where did that third moon come from?”*  The cosmos contradicts itself, and the illusion of a coherent reality fractures.
### Why It Matters
- Plot holes rupture **continuity** — the narrative flow that carries readers through cause, effect, and emotional development.  
- They weaken *trust* between storyteller and audience: when events do not follow, stakes lose weight and outcomes lose meaning.  
- The story ceases to feel discoverable; it starts to feel contrived.

### Prevention
Plot holes close easily when the creator honors the same **[[The SANC Charter]]** that governs WMB worldcraft:
- keep the chain of events **Sufficient and Necessary** — every action must have a reason *and* a result,  
- verify cause, consequence, and chronology,  
- and use **revision** the way physics uses conservation — nothing disappears without leaving a trace.

### In Short
> **Continuity keeps the story straight.**  
> **Consistency keeps the cosmos sound.**

Together they form the dual obligations of **World*making****:  
- one to the *mythosic weave* of narrative,  
- the other to the *logosic fabric* of the cosmos itself.

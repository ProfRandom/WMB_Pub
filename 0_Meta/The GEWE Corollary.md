## 🧩 Definition

**GEWE** stands for **Good Enough for Worldmaking Efforts.**  

It establishes a **pragmatic threshold of adequacy** — the point where further precision no longer improves plausibility, comprehension, or narrative engagement.

> [!note]  
> GEWE is not an excuse for sloppiness; it is an *ethic of proportion.*  
> The aim is not maximum detail, but *meaningful detail.*

## ⚙️ Application

When deciding whether a calculation or definition needs more refinement, apply the **GEWE Test**:

| **Criterion** | **Ask Yourself** | **If Yes, Proceed; If No, Stop.** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Perceptibility** | Would the difference be *noticeable* to a character, observer, or reader? | If no, round it. |
| **Consequence** | Does the precision *change behavior or outcome* in the system? | If no, simplify. |
| **Communicability** | Will the added complexity *clarify* or *confuse* understanding? | If confuse, omit. |
| **Narrative Impact** | Does this detail *enhance* the story, theme, or aesthetic? | If not, it’s indulgent. |

## 🧮 Practical Examples

- **Orbital periods:**  
  If the correct value is 365.24219 days, but the difference from 365.25 days amounts to minutes per decade — *GEWE applies.*  
- **Surface gravity:**  
  Round 1.009⨁ to 1.01⨁ unless the extra precision alters escape velocity or atmospheric retention.  
- **Axial tilt:**  
  23.43° vs. 23.4° — *indistinguishable at narrative scale.*  

In WMB, any figure with precision finer than its **perceptual or functional scale** violates GEWE.

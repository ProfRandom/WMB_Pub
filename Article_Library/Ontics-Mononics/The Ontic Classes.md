# The Ontic Classes

All physical bodies (_monons_) in the WMB framework are described along two orthogonal axes:
- their **Ontic Class**, which defines the degree of _gravity-dominated_ self-coherence, and
- their **Morphological Character**, which defines material composition and structure.

Monons first divide into **Coheromons** (cohesion-bound) and **Gravitomons** (gravity-bound).

Only _gravitomons_ admit Ontic Class distinctions, because these classes arise from **gravitational self-organization**, **compression physics**, and **fusion thresholds**.

At the broadest gravitational scale, all **gravitomons** fall into one of three Ontic Classes:
- **Duramons** — all gravitomons with masses below the stellar ignition threshold ($< 0.08$ ⊙).  
    Includes every non-fusional body of mass $> 1 \times 10^{-6} \;\oplus$ : from brown dwarfs and planemons down to micromons.    
- **Fusamons** — all gravitomons with masses in the stable hydrogen-fusion range ($0.08–300$ ⊙).  
    Subdivided by the **stellar spectral-class system**, which defines their thermodynamic and photometric behavior.    
- **Peramons** — all gravitomons whose masses exceed the upper stellar-stability limit ($> 300$ ⊙).  
    These occupy the **trans-stellar regime** of radiative instability, pair-creation collapse, or exotic compact states.

## **Ontic Axis (Vertical)**

_Defines gravitational scale and self-coherence — how strongly a body’s gravity shapes its structure._

- Applies **only to gravitomons**    
- Ranges from micromons to hypermons    
- Reflects internal pressure, compression, fusion onset, and relativistic collapse    
- Field: **Mononics**
    
## **Morphological Axis (Horizontal)**

_Defines material/structural composition — what the body is made of._

- Applies to **both coheromons and gravitomons**    
- Describes the dominant matter-regime: lithic, hydruric, cryic, metalluric, plasma, degenerate, etc.    
- Field: **Morphotics**
## Definitions

- **Morphotype**:  
    The primary compositional descriptor of a monon — its dominant physical “substance” or structural character  
    (e.g., _lithic_, _argeic_, _hydruric_).
    
- **Category / Envelope**:  
    An emergent classification expressing systemic context and behavior, derived from the combination of a monon’s mass domain and its morphotype  
    (e.g., _geotic_, _telluric_, _xenotic_).

> **Summary:**  
> The _Mononic axis_ quantifies — **how gravitationally self-coherent a body is**.  
> The _Morphological axis_ qualifies — **what the body is made of**.  
> The _Categorical envelope_ contextualizes — **how those traits express within a stellar or planetary system**.

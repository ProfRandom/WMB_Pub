# Duramon Equations of State

The Duramon Equations of State summarize the full set of interdependent relationships among a spherical body's mass $m$, radius $r$, density $\rho$, surface gravity $g$, and escape velocity $v_e$​. Because each variable can be expressed in terms of any pair of the others, the system forms a closed algebraic network: choose two parameters, and all remaining quantities follow deterministically.

The table below organizes these transformations row-wise. Each row holds a complete “family” of equivalent expressions generated by treating one of the five primary variables as the fundamental independent input. This gives you a quick way to translate between formulations depending on what you’re modeling — whether you're solving for planetary structure, estimating gravitational behavior, or exploring exotic material states in the Duramon context.

The goal is not to introduce new physics, but to provide a compact and internally consistent toolkit for any situation where two known properties must yield the other three. Think of it as the planetary-mechanics analogue of thermodynamic identities: tight, symmetric, and ready for creative deployment.

m = \dfrac{g^3}{\rho^2} & r = \sqrt[3]{\dfrac{m}{\rho}} & \rho = \sqrt{\dfrac{g^3}{m}} & g = \sqrt[3]{m\rho^2} & v_e = \dfrac{g}{\sqrt{\rho}}\\
m = \dfrac{v_e^3}{\sqrt{\rho}} & r = \dfrac{v_e}{\sqrt{\rho}} & \rho = \left(\dfrac{v_e}{r}\right)^2 & g = v_e\sqrt{\rho} & v_e = \sqrt[4]{m g}\\
m = \dfrac{v_e^4}{g} & r = \dfrac{v_e^2}{g} & \rho = \left(\dfrac{g}{v_e}\right)^2 & g = \dfrac{v_e^2}{r} & v_e = r\sqrt{\rho}\\
m = r v_e^2 & r = \dfrac{m}{v_e^2} & \rho = \left(\dfrac{v_e^3}{m}\right)^2 & g = \dfrac{v_e^4}{m} & v_e = \sqrt[6]{m^2\rho}

Duramon equations conventionally use **lower-case variables** ($m$, $r$, $\rho$, $g$, $v_e$) to emphasize their domain: compact, high-density bodies whose structure is governed primarily by internal material constraints rather than stellar-scale energy processes. This contrasts with the **stellamon state equations**, which employ **upper-case forms**($M$, $R$, $T$, $K$, $Q$, $L$) to distinguish the vastly different regimes of mass, scale, and pressure involved.

The capitalization isn’t aesthetic — it’s categorical. Lower-case identifies matter-bound, mechanically dominated bodies; upper-case flags fusion-driven, radiative systems. Mixing conventions would produce mathematical ambiguity and, worse, physical nonsense. So the typographic divide holds firm: **duramon → lower-case**, **stellamon → upper-case**.

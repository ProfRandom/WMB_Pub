# Mononic Classification Canon
## Ontological Reasoning

The **Monon Condition** identifies bodies that arise through the _natural self-organization of matter under fundamental forces_ — gravitational collapse, electromagnetic cohesion, chemical bonding, nuclear binding, and related interactions.

Artificial constructs (spacecraft, habitats, megastructures, cities) are **assemblages of monons**, but their unity is _contextual_, _mechanical_, or _intentional_ — never intrinsic.  
Their coherence depends on design, maintenance, or structural joining, rather than any single dominating natural force that defines them as a **singular self-coherent body**.

### Classification Rule — The Monon Condition

>**All WMB monon series** (micromon, planemon, intermon, stellamon, etc.) apply _only_ to **naturally occurring, self-coherent bodies**, not to artificial structures, multi&#8209;body systems, collections, or diffuse regions.

### 🔒 What *Is* a Monon

A **monon** is any _singular, naturally self-coherent body_ — a structure whose unity arises from its own internal physical forces rather than from assembly or external constraint.

A monon is defined by three essential criteria:

### **1. A single, well-defined center of cohesion**

Typically a **center of mass**, but more generally any point or region around which the body maintains internal unity.

Cohesion may arise from:
- chemical bonding,    
- electromagnetic structure,    
- self-gravitation, or    
- nuclear binding.
### 2. Internal self-coherence under a dominant physical force

A monon’s structure is maintained by one **primary** force regime — chemical, gravitational, electromagnetic, or nuclear — depending on its scale.

This is what distinguishes monons from *assemblages*: a monon’s unity is **inherent**, not manufactured.
### 3. A physically continuous volume or field-defined boundary

A monon occupies one **contiguous region** of space (or spacetime).  
Black holes qualify because an **event horizon** defines a coherent boundary.
#### Examples of Monon Series

**micromons**, **minimons**, **mesomons**, **planemons**, **intermons**,  
**stellamons**, **supramons**, **ultramons**, **hypermons**

(These represent _mass-domain tiers_, not different ontological kinds.)
## **Monon-Series Rule (Scope Clarification)**

> **All mononic classifications** (micromon, planemon, stellamon, cryptomon, etc.) apply **only** to individual, contiguous, self-bound bodies.
> 
> Multi-object systems — whether binary, ternary, resonant, or aggregate — are **not** monons, even if every member of the system _is_ a monon.

This distinction separates:

- **monons** (single self-coherent bodies),  from    
	- **cules** (homogeneous multi-bodies),    
	- **lexes** (heterogeneous systems), and    
	- **gates** (macro-aggregations).

### 🚫 What *Is Not* a Monon

A body is **not** a monon if its unity arises from **multiple centers of cohesion**, **diffuse structure**, or **assembly**, rather than from a _single intrinsic force regime_.

|Category|Example|Why It Is _Not_ a Monon|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Star Clusters**|Globular clusters, open clusters|Many separate gravitational centers → _multicule / gate_, not monon|
|**Nebulae & Clouds**|GMCs, H II regions|Diffuse, non-contiguous mass lacking a coherent boundary|
|**Galaxies**|Milky Way, Andromeda|Aggregations of billions of monons; unity is contextual, not intrinsic|
|**Binary Systems**|Sirius A + B, Pluto–Charon|≥2 centers of cohesion → system-level _cule_|
|**Black-Hole Binaries**|LIGO inspiral pairs|Two distinct event horizons → a lex or cule, not a monon|
|**Artificial Constructs**|Voyager 1, stations, megastructures|Assembled by intent; coherence is engineered, not natural|
## Summary of Principles

### 1. Monon Series is not emergent.
A collection of monons does not “scale up” into a larger monon.
- A gate of planemons **is not** a larger planemon.    
- A cule of stellamons **is not** a single stellamon.    

Aggregates *never* collapse into higher mononic categories.    

Only **intrinsic self-coherence** produces monons.
### 2. Modeling convenience ≠ ontological unity.

Orbital mechanics often treats binary systems as one “effective mass” at their barycenter.  
This is a **mathematical abstraction**, not a physical body.

**The barycenter is not a monon.  
The system is not a monon.  
Only the individual bodies are monons.**

### 3. Distinct fields of cohesion define distinct entities.

- A monon has **one** center of cohesion (even if dynamic or extended).    
- A system has **two or more** discrete centers, even if the orbits form a stable configuration.    

This boundary is the dividing line between:

- monon    
- cule (homogeneous multi-monon)    
- lex (heterogeneous system)    
- gate (large-scale aggregate)
## Summary

Taken together, these boundaries form the foundation of the **Mononic Classification Canon**.

Monons are singular, naturally self-coherent bodies; systems, clusters, and constructs are _not._

This distinction anchors every higher tier of classification — from **cules** and **lexes** to the large-scale **gates** that bind galaxies and clusters.

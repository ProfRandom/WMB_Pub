## The Small Angle Approximation
When the apparent angular size ($\theta$) of an object (or the distance between two objects) in the sky is small — typically less than 10° — the sine and tangent of $\theta$ are nearly equal to $\theta$ itself when measured in radians:

$$
\theta ≈ \frac{d}{D} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 57.2958\;\frac{d}{D}
$$
Where:
- $\theta$ = angular diameter (in degrees)
- $d$ = true diameter of the object (or separation between the objects)
- $D$ = distance to the object in the same units as $d$

When working in radians:

$$
\theta^c = \frac{d}{D}
$$
Where:
- $\theta^c$ = angular diameter (in radianss)
- $d$ = true diameter of the object (or separation between the objects)
- $D$ = distance to the object in the same units as $d$

## Measuring Exactly
If one wants to be precise, the appropriate equation is:

$$
\theta^c = 2\;arctan\;\left(\frac{d}{2D}\right)
$$
Where:
- $\theta^c$ = angular diameter (in radianss)
- $d$ = true diameter of the object (or separation between the objects)
- $D$ = distance to the object in the same units as $d$

To get the angle in degrees, convert:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\theta^\circ = 2\;arctan\;\left(\dfrac{d}{2D}\right) \times \dfrac{180}{\pi} \\
\theta^\circ = 2\;arctan\;\left(\dfrac{d}{2D}\right) \times 57.2958
\end{array}
$$
## Approximating Angular Sizes (or Separations)
But, how does one arrive at an angular measure in the first place?  Well, there's this thing called a sextant....

Actually, there's a much simpler method using an instrument almost everyone has with them at all times — the hand at the end of their arm.  When the arm is fully extended, the hand (and its various parts) form a remarkably consistent angular ruler:

| Gesture                                              | Approximate<br>Angle | Notes                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Width of little finger                               | ≈ 1°                 | about twice the apparent diameter of the Sun or Moon |
| Width of first three fingers                         | ≈ 15°                | a convenient "finder field" in binoculars            |
| Width of closed fist                                 | ≈ 10°                | one _decadal_ unit — useful for quick sky hops       |
| Span from thumb to little finger ("rock on" gesture) | ≈ 20 – 25°           | a coarse measure for constellation spans             |
The most use a worldmaker will find for this trick is when you have calculated the size in degrees of something in your world's sky (or the separation between two objects in the heavens), you can get a sense for how "really" big that would appear by holding out your hand and approximating the appropriate angular measure.

For instance; say you've calculated that your world's sun is about $3^\circ$ in the sky... that's about the width of the first two fingers held up at arm's length.

This is essentially the **practical inverse** of the *small-angle approximation* discussed earlier.

#### Universally Applicable
Because hand and arm proportions scale together with age and body size, this method works for nearly everyone — from children to giants — with only slight variations. And since this is an *approximate* method to begin with, those small differences can be safely ignored.

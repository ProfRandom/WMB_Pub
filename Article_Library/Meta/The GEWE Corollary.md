## 🧩 Definition

**GEWE** stands for **Good Enough for Worldmaking Efforts.**  

It establishes a **pragmatic threshold of adequacy** — the point the needs of the story or the game outweigh the limitations of technical precision.

- The math says the planet's year is 319.789 days long... call it 320 because it makes the math and the calendar easier.
- A planet-sized moon of a gas giant can't really orbit that close without tidal stresses causing the giant to hover just below hydrogen flash?  Yeah, but the drama of the setting is too cool not to explore!

# 🧩 Definition

GEWE stands for **Good Enough for Worldmaking Efforts**.

It marks the pragmatic threshold of adequacy — the point where the needs of the *story, culture, drama*, or *play experience* outweigh strict technical precision.

GEWE is the creator’s quiet permission to say:

> *Mundus meum est* — "It's *my* world."
 
And honestly?  Who’s going to check your math?

GEWE exists for the moments when a world works better if you bend truth rather than break story.
# 🌍 Examples Across Crafting and Building

## Astronomical (Crafting → Logos bending slightly toward Mythos)

The orbital calculation says the year is 319.789 days.
The people of the setting do not care. Their calendar does not care.
The story certainly does not care.
**Call it 320**.
Move on.

That beautiful Mars-sized moon?
Physics says it should be ripped apart by tidal forces.
Drama says it should glow over the ocean during the sacred solstice rite.
**Drama wins**.

## Biological

Real-world mules are sterile hybrids.
But Jolette’s livelihood — and the entire plot of Book Three — depends on her prize mule siring offspring.
Biology balks.
GEWE smiles.
**In this world, mules are fertile.**

The apex predator should have a gestation period of months.
But your story needs “eggs hatch overnight.”
**GEWE approves this accelerated embryology.**

## Cultural / Sociological (Solidly Building)

A real medieval village couldn’t support three specialized guilds.
But this village is narratively framed as a cultural crossroads.
Reality says no.
**Mythos says yes.**
GEWE nods.

The economics of your floating sky-city are handwavy at best.
But emotionally and symbolically, it must exist.
**GEWE keeps the city aloft.**

## Magical / Metaphysical

Your cosmology says spellcasting draws from a finite reservoir.
Your protagonist really needs one more spell in this scene.
GEWE whispers:
**“This once, she reaches deeper.”**

The magic system has rules…
…which the gods break whenever it's dramatically appropriate.
**GEWE considers this a feature.**

## Ecological / Environmental

A planet with that albedo, atmosphere, and orbital distance should be frozen.
But your story requires a thriving temperate forest.
Enter GEWE:
**“There’s an unmodeled greenhouse factor. That’s all anyone needs to know.”**

This valley has more biodiversity than is plausible for its latitude.
GEWE:
**“It’s a refugium. Done.”**

## Physics / Technology

The starship’s power budget says it can’t possibly run life support and weapons at full strength.
But the set-piece battle requires both.
GEWE:
**“Fine. One capacitor bank is experimental. Don’t worry about it.”**

Faster-than-light communications violate causality?
Only if you let them.
**GEWE suspends disbelief so the plot can speak.**

# 🎭 Core Principle

“So,” you're probably asking, “what’s the point of WMB if it can all be ignored, anyway?”

The point is that WMB gives you two *equally reputable* creative choices:

1. **Ignore logos intelligently**, or  
2. **Challenge yourself to honor the physics and make the story work anyway.**

Both are valid. Both are responsible.

GEWE is not about being sloppy; it’s about choosing **coherence of experience** over **coherence of calculation** when the two collide.

When story, character, emotion, theme, or symbolism would suffer under strict precision, GEWE steps in and says:

> **“Bend the rule. Not the world.”**

Let [[Cascading Rounding Notation]] handle the numerical honesty.  
**GEWE protects the narrative truth.**

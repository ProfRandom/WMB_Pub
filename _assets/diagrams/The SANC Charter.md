> [!axiom] **Principle of Practical Empowerment**  
> The purpose of WMB is not to make worlds *correct*, but to make them *coherent.*  
> To that end, every law within it obeys the rule of **SANC** —

## ⚙️ The First Form — **S**cience-**A**djacent, **N**o **C**alculus

WMB operates *adjacent* to real science: close enough for rigor, far enough for freedom.

To that end:

- Uses **algebra, geometry, and trigonometry** — the practical tools any builder can wield.  
- **Not used:** calculus, tensors, or full astrophysics — those live outside our scope.

> [!axiom] **Rigor without rigidity.**  
> Enough math to make worlds believable, never so much that it strangles imagination.

## 🧮 The Second Form — **S**traightforward, **A**ppropriate, **N**otationally **C**lear

- **Straightforward:** Every concept is paired with a usable, illustrated example.  
- **Approximate:** When precision matters, we keep it; when approximation suffices, we mark it — explicitly.  
  - This leads to a companion rule:  
    [[The GEWE Corollary]] — **Good Enough for Worldmaking Efforts**  
    > Think of **GEWE** as the *WMB GUI* 😉 — the friendly interface between rigor and play.  
- **Notationally Clear:** Symbols remain consistent, legible, and reusable across all modules.

> [!axiom] **Clarity sustains coherence.**  
> The clearer the notation, the stronger the connection between idea and implementation.

## 🧩 The Third Form — **S**ufficient **A**nd **N**ecessary **C**onstructs

At its core, WMB builds **models only as complex as they need to be** to serve a worldmaking goal — *and no more.*  
Every equation, taxonomy, or symbolic rule must pass two tests:

| **Criterion** | **Question** | **Purpose** |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Necessity** | Does it capture a relationship that materially affects the behavior or believability of the cosmos? | Keeps the model honest. |
| **Sufficiency** | Is it simple, accessible, and practical while preserving the needed clarity and accuracy? | Keeps the model usable. |

> [!axiom] **Build no clockwork where a sundial will do.**

## 🧭 The Fourth Form — **S**elf-**A**djusting, **N**on-**C**oercive

Worlds are living systems; their models should breathe.

- **Self-Adjusting:** Whenever possible, WMB formulas and frameworks are built to rebalance themselves when conditions change.  
  - If a model breaks under a new parameter, that’s a *signal*, not a failure.  
  - Builders should refine the boundary, not blame the equation.

- **Non-Coercive:** No rule in WMB is absolute.  
  - A law that cannot flex is not a law of *making*; it’s a law of *limitation.*  
  - Every construct is an invitation to experiment — a guideline, not a guardrail.

> [!axiom] **Coherence, not control.**  
> A worldwright’s task is to build systems that sustain themselves, not obey their maker.
